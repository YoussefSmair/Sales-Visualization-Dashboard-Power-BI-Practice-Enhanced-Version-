This project is an enhanced version of my previous Sales Visualization Power BI practice.

In this version, I focused on improving the overall dashboard design, adding multiple report pages, and organizing visuals in a clearer way.

The goal of this project is learning and practicing Power BI visualization, page navigation, and basic dashboard building rather than advanced analytics.
